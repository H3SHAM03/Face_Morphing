Task 4✅ – Fourier Transform Mixer
Design and implement a desktop program that explains the relative importance of the magnitude and phase
components as well emphasizing the frequencies different contributions to the signal. We will do this task on a 2D signal
(i.e. image) just for clarity but the same concept applies to any signal. Your software should have the following features:
Images Viewers:
- Ability to open and view four gray scale images, each in one “viewport”.
a. No Colored: If the user opens a colored image, the program should convert it to grayscale.
b. One Size: At any point of time, the sizes of the opened images have to be unified on the smallest size of all of
them.
c. FT Components: For each image, the program should have two displays (one fixed display for the image, while
the second display can show several components based on a combo-box/drop-menu selection of 1) FT
Magnitude, 2) FT Phase, 3) FT Real, and 4) FT Imaginary components.
d. Easy Browse: The user can change any of the images by just double clicking on its viewer (Browse function for
this specific image).
- Two Output Ports: The mixer result can be shown in one of two output viewports. Each output viewport is exactly
similar to the input image viewport. The user should control in which viewport the new mixer result will
show/resides.
- Brightness/Contrast: In any image viewport, the user can change the brightness/contrast (i.e. window/level) of the
image via mouse dragging (up/down and left/right). This should be doable on any of the four components as well.
Components Mixer:
- Any output image is the ifft of a weight average of the FT of the input four images. The user should be able to
customize the weights of each image FT via sliders. Think of how to do such customized weights for two
components (e.g. magnitude and phase, or real and imaginary) in an intuitive user interface.
Regions Mixer:
- For each FT component, the user should be able to pick which region that will be taken for the output, inner region
(i.e. low frequencies) or out region (i.e. high frequencies). This should be done by rectangle drawn on each FT, with

an option for the user to include the inner or outer region, and the selected region highlighted (via semi-
transparent coloring or hashing) to represent the selection. The size (or percentage) of region rectangle should be

customizable for the user via a slider or resize handles. Note that this region should be unified for all the four
images.
Realtime Mixing:
- The mixing process requires an ifft operation which takes some time to be performed. Such lengthy operation
usually requires a progress bar shown for the user to indicate the update of the process.
- If the user changes the mixing settings and requests an update while the previous operation is still running, the
program should just cancel the previous operation and start the new request one (Check Threads!)
